# PortfolioRepo

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio. Here you will find a couple of files:

Course5FinalProject.ipynb: This was the final project for the "Python Project for Data Science" course that I took through IBM's Data Analyst Certificate program. It involves using Python for webscraping and analyzing stock data. 

Course6FinalProject.ipynb: This was part of the final exam for the "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" course I took through the same IBM program. It involves using SQL to query and analyze real-world data about Chicago. 

The FinalAssignment_Part2.pdf is a pdf of some dashboards I created in IBM Cognos for a Data Visualization and Dashboards course I took through the same IBM Certificate course on Coursera. 

The firstpython.py file is just a test file, and you can ignore it. More python code will likely be added later!
