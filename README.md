For my capstone project, I cleaned and normalized data using Python, analyzed and visualized data using Python, summarized the key takeaways through dashboards I created with IBM Cognos, and then created this powerpoint presentation to summarize my report of my data findings. The dashboards I created are referenced in the presentation.
